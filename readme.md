# PyRC

A simple Twitch IRC client written in Python

Built to the [Twitch specification](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc) which follows
 [RFC1459](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459.html).
 
**Note: This is mostly just a way to get familiar with Twitch's IRC and IRC in general. Other clients will be better.**
